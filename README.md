\# Creation of a LLM using Transformers from Scratch



\## Plan (in french here)



\- Neurone

\- Réseau de neurone / MLP

\- Tokenizer

\- Embedding

\- Self Attention

\- Transformer

\- Trainer

\- Inference





## 1 Neuron class
(easiest one)

For the neuron class creation we need the following parameters:
- weights
- bias

I have y = wx + b 
where :
x --> input
w --> weights
b --> bias
y --> output of the neuron

## Then i need to implement

## Sources

- What i remember from Andrej Karpathy videos on the subject




## What i learnt in the project

- pip freeze > requirements.txt   --> take installed versions and write them in requirements.txt
